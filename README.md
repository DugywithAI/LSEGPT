# LSE Navigator Chatbot

## Overview

The LSE Navigator Chatbot is designed to assist users in navigating and obtaining information about the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE). With the vast and complex structure of the LSE's online resources, finding specific information can be a daunting task. Our chatbot aims to simplify this process, providing quick and accurate responses to inquiries about LSE's academic programs, admissions, student life, and more.

## Methodology

To create a chatbot specialized in providing detailed information about LSE, we employed the following technologies and resources:

- **OpenAI API**: Leveraging OpenAI's powerful language models, we've developed a responsive and intelligent chat interface capable of understanding and answering a wide range of user queries.

- **Llama-Index**: Utilized for querying over multiple documents, Llama-Index enhances our chatbot's ability to search through extensive documentation and provide relevant answers. This feature is particularly useful for complex questions that require insights from multiple sources.

- **LSE Student Manuals**: We've incorporated open-sourced undergraduate and postgraduate student guides into our dataset. By doing so, the chatbot has direct access to authoritative information about courses, departments, faculty, and campus resources, ensuring that the answers it provides are both accurate and up to date.

## Features

- **Easy Navigation**: Users can easily find information about various aspects of LSE without having to manually search through the website.
